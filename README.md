# Mongoose CRUD App

## Overview

The Mongoose CRUD App is a simple application that demonstrates how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Mongoose, a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. This application is built using Node.js and Express, providing a robust foundation for building RESTful APIs.

## Features

- **Create**: Add new records to the database.
- **Read**: Retrieve and display records from the database.
- **Update**: Modify existing records in the database.
- **Delete**: Remove records from the database.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- MongoDB installed and running.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mongoose-crud-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd mongoose-crud-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the server using `nodemon`, which automatically restarts the server when file changes are detected.

2. Access the application:

   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your `index.js` file).

## Dependencies

- **cors**: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **express**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
- **multer**: Middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, which is primarily used for uploading files.
- **nodemon**: A tool that helps develop Node.js applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes are detected.
